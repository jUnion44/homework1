What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Git merge combines the history of one branch with that of another, essentially combining the changes made to each file in each branch.  Rebasing appends the changes in one branch to the tip of the other, which although does not reqire a commit, it can be destructive.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repositry that exists in the cloud that one or more users can push to to synchronize their code.  In a typical workflow, teammates would edit code locally, push their branches to the remote repository, and merge their changes into the main branch.
